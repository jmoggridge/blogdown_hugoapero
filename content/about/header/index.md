# Hi, I'm Jason Moggridge

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

In my work as a data analyst, I frequently use R, Rstudio, `tidyverse` packages, `ggplot2`, `ggiraph`, `plotly`, `leaflet`, `shiny`, and `Rmarkdown` to perform analyses and communicate my results to my PI and other stakeholders.


This blog will talk about data analysis and R programming (mostly) :maple_leaf:. I'll try to provide helpful code snippets for specific tasks that you might encounter as an R programmer or researcher.

<!-- The page you are reading is based on a markdown file- look in `content/about/` to edit. There, look inside the `header`, `main`, and `sidebar` folders to get started building your own "about" page. -->
